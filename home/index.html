            My name is Freddie. I am a student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and
            Economics at Boston University. With a strong foundation in both technical and analytical disciplines,
            I am passionate about applying programming skills, data analysis, and economic theory to solve
            real-world challenges. My academic journey has been complemented by hands-on experience in software
            development, research, and leadership roles in university clubs. Eager to contribute my skills and
            grow in a dynamic, innovative environment, I am seeking opportunities to further my expertise in
            software development, data analytics, and economics-driven technology solutions.
